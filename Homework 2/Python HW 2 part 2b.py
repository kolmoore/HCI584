# Python HW 2 - part 2b

# Guess the number game  (inspired by the binary search from HCI 574 lecture 14)

### version 2 - implement any (or all) of these features:
# on wrong guess, add info if guess was too high or too low
# keep track of number of guesses and print out the guess number before the user's input and, on success, the number of guesses that were required
# Optional: set a round limit (e.g. 5 rounds to guess correctly) and print out the number of remaining guesses instead of then guess number. Quit after limit has been reached.

    "## Google Books Example project for HCI584 - Part A\n",
    "- this assignment will walk through creating a simple but expandable app that searches for book by title in a database and displays information such as title, author, date, description, etc.\n",
    "- Initially, we will use a command line interface (CLI) to search a simple database (a csv file) and display the results. (part A)\n",
    "- We will then create  Desktop GUI app, using TKinter with only a few simple widgets.  (part B)\n",
    "- We will then replace the csv file database with the Google Books API and use the same GUI to interact with it. (part C)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will go over several steps that are meant to prepare you for similar activities when you do your own project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a simple sketch of the app\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define the tasks/interactions, set up a simple GUI, go over what needs to happen in your code to support each interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Write a more detailed project spec\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add details:  How will data be handled/stored? Which API and packages can we use? What are more complex tasks we might want to support later?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Implement a version 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    Keep it simple but do it right! Explore the data. Isolate the non-Gui parts and write code for them in isolation. Test them in isolation! Then write the GUI and connect it to the other parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Optional: Implement more complex tasks, polish things (this would correspond to your version 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note A) \n",
    "- In the beginning we will use notebooks b/c they can integrate text, drawing, etc. \n",
    "- We will use use a notebook for our data exploration and for most non-GUI parts. \n",
    "- After that we will switch to  .py files and make use of the debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note B) \n",
    "- Although this is essentially my project, there will be parts for you to implement yourself or at least modify and add to my code. \n",
    "- This will probably involve a lot of googling - that's totally fine, I just want you to get used to solving small well-defined problems and glue them together, before you start your own project.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note C)\n",
    "- This is the first time I'm doing this project, so I'm not sure how long it will take.\n",
    "- Also, I would be very grateful for feedback on how to improve it! Put your feedback as comments in the notebook or the .py files. Thank you!"

Animals,Studies in Global Animal Law,Anne Peters,3662607565.0,"This open access book contains 13 contributions on global animal law, preceded by an introduction which explains key concepts and methods. Global Animal Law refers to the sum of legal rules and principles (both state-made and non-state-made) governing the interaction between humans and other animals, on a domestic, local, regional, and international level. Global animal law is the response to the mismatch between almost exclusively national animal-related legislation on the one hand, and the global dimension of the animal issue on the other hand. The chapters lay some historical foundations in the ius naturae et gentium, examine various aspects of how national and international law traditionally deals with animals as commodity; and finally suggest new legal concepts and protective strategies. The book shows numerous entry points for animal issues in international law and at the same time shifts the focus and scope of inquiry."
Animals,Life After Logging,E. Meijaard,9793361565.0,"This book presents a technical review of ecological and life history information on a range of Bornean wildlife species, aimed at identifying what makes these species sensitive to timber harvesting practices and associated impacts. It addresses three audiences: 1) those involved in assessing and regulating timber harvesting activities in Southeast Asia, 2) those involved in trying to achieve conservation goals in the region, and 3) those undertaking research to improve multipurpose forest management. This book shows that forest management can be improved in many simple ways to allow timber extraction and wildlife conservation to be more compatible than under current practices. The recommendations can also be valuable to the many governmental and non-governmental organisations promoting sustainable forest management and eco-labelling. Finally, it identifies a number of shortcomings and gaps in knowledge, which the hope can interest the scientific community and promote further research. This review is, an important scientific step toward understanding and improving sustainable forestry practices for long-term biodiversity conservation. Even in the short term, however, significant improvements can be made to improve both conservation and the efficiency of forest management, and there is no need to delay action due to a perceived lack of information. In the longer term it is expected that the recommendations from this review will be implemented, and that further research will continue to help foster an acceptable balance among the choices needed to maintain healthy wildlife populations and biodiversity in a productive forest estate."
Architecture,Everyday Streets,Agustina Martire ,1800084404.0,"Everyday streets are both the most used and most undervalued of cities public spaces. They are places of social aggregation, bringing together those belonging to different classes, genders, ages, ethnicities and nationalities. They comprise not just the familiar outdoor spaces that we use to move and interact but also urban blocks, interiors, depths and hinterlands, which are integral to their nature and contribute to their vitality. Everyday streets are physically and socially shaped by the lives of the people and things that inhabit them through a reciprocal dance with multiple overlapping temporalities. The primary focus of this book is an inclusive approach to understanding and designing everyday streets. It offers an analysis of many aspects of everyday streets from cities around the globe. From the regular rectilinear urban blocks of Montreal to the military-regulated narrow alleyways of Naples, and from the resilient market streets of London to the crammed commercial streets of Chennai, the streets in this book were all conceived with a certain level of control. Everyday Streets is a palimpsest of methods, perspectives and recommendations that together provide a solid understanding of everyday streets, their degree of inclusiveness, and to what extent they could be more inclusive."
Architecture,Erholung in siedlungsnahen Wäldern,Susanne Karn,3728141259.0,"Siedlungsnahe Wälder gehören zu den beliebtesten Naherholungsräumen und werden für Freizeitaktivitäten stark genutzt. Die Infrastruktur im Wald könnte jedoch verbessert und noch wirksamer für den Menschen ausgestaltet werden. Oftmals könnte mit wenigen Mitteln viel erreicht werden. Damit könnte ein spürbarer Beitrag für die psychische und physische Gesundheit aller Waldnutzer:innen geleistet werden. In dieser Publikation werden beispielhaft konkrete Massnahmen zur Verbesserung der Erholungsqualitäten im Wald aufgezeigt. Eine Toolbox unterstützt die Arbeit an der Erholungsplanung und es werden Handlungsempfehlungen für den Planungsprozess gegeben. Beispielhafte Erholungswälder zeigen, welchen besonderen Wert die Waldgebiete für die Bevölkerung erhalten können, wenn verschiedene Aspekte gut berücksichtigt sind. Das Buch eignet sich als anregende Ideensammlung und Wahrnehmungsschärfung bei der eigenen Arbeit im und am Wald und gibt Hinweise zur Weiterentwicklung von gesetzlichen und planerischen Grundlagen, Planungsprozessen und Fachwissen."
Architecture,Public Space in Transition,Dahae Lee,3839462320.0,"Teheran-ro in Seoul and Mediaspree area in Berlin are pristine examples for public spaces with a history of rapid change in the context of broader political and economic transitions. Dahae Lee shows that in such a transitional context, the public sector alone is incapable to provide and manage public space. Hence, it engages private sector entities in the form of privately owned public space/s (POPS). By analysing the planning instruments used for POPS in both cases, their uniqueness as well as strengths and weaknesses are revealed. Based on the results this study offers a number of policy recommendations for cities that encounter similar problems."
Architecture,Co-curating the City,Clare Melhuish,1800081820.0,"Co-curating the City explores the role of universities in the construction and mobilisation of heritage discourses in urban development and regeneration processes, with a focus on six case study sites: University of Gothenburg (Sweden), UCL East (London), University of Lund (Sweden). Roma Tre university (Rome), American University of Beirut, and Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil. The aim of the book is to expand the field of critical heritage studies in the urban domain, by examining the role of institutional actors both in the construction of urban heritage discourses and in how those discourses influence urban planning decisions or become instrumentalised as mechanisms for urban regeneration. It proposes that universities engage in these processes in a number of ways: as producers of urban knowledge that is mobilised to intervene in planning processes; as producers of heritage practices that are implemented in development contexts in the urban realm; and as developers engaged in campus construction projects that both reference heritage discourses as a mechanism for promoting support and approval by planners and the public, and capitalise on heritage assets as a resource. The book highlights the participatory processes through which universities are positioning themselves as significant institutions in the development of urban heritage narratives. The case studies investigate how universities, as mixed communities of interest dispersed across buildings and urban sites, engage in strategies of engagement with local people and neighbourhoods, and ask how this may be contributing to a re-shaping of ideas, narratives, and lived experience of urban heritage in which universities have a distinctive agency. The authors cross disciplinary and cultural boundaries, and bridge academia and practice."
Architecture,Latour for Architects,Albena Yaneva,1000546543.0,"Bruno Latour is one of the leading figures in Social Sciences today, but his contributions are also widely recognised in the arts. His theories flourished in the 1980s in the aftermath of the structuralism wave and generated new concepts and methodologies for the understanding of the social. In the past decade, Latour and his Actor-Network Theory (ANT) have gained popularity among researchers in the field of architecture. Latour for Architects is the first introduction to the key concepts and ideas of Bruno Latour that are relevant to architects. First, the book discusses critically how specific methods and insights from his philosophy can inspire new thinking in architecture and design pedagogy. Second, it explores examples from architectural practice and urban design, and reviews recent attempts to extend the methods of ANT into the fields of architectural and urban studies. Third, the book advocates an ANT-inspired approach to architecture, and examines how its methodological insights can trace new research avenues in the field, reflecting meticulously on its epistemological offerings. Drawing on many lively examples from the world of architectural practice, the book makes a compelling argument about the agency of architectural design and the role architects can play in re-ordering the world we live in. Following Latours philosophy offers a new way to handle all the objects of human and nonhuman collective life, to re-examine the role of matter in design practice, and to redefine the forms of social, political and ethical associations that bind us together in cities."
Architecture,Spatial Revolution,Christina E. Crawford,1501759205.0,"Spatial Revolution is the first comparative parallel study of Soviet architecture and planning to create a narrative arc across a vast geography. The narrative binds together three critical industrial-residential projects in Baku, Magnitogorsk, and Kharkiv, built during the first fifteen years of the Soviet project and followed attentively worldwide after the collapse of capitalist markets in 1929. Among the revelations provided by Christina E. Crawford is the degree to which outside experts participated in the construction of the Soviet industrial complex, while facing difficult topographies, near-impossible deadlines, and inchoate theories of socialist space-making. Crawford describes how early Soviet architecture and planning activities were kinetic and negotiated and how questions about the proper distribution of people and industry under socialism were posed and refined through the construction of brick and mortar, steel and concrete projects, living laboratories that tested alternative spatial models. As a result, Spatial Revolution answers important questions of how the first Soviet industrialization drive was a catalyst for construction of thousands of new enterprises on remote sites across the Eurasian continent, an effort that spread to far-flung sites in other socialist statesand capitalist welfare statesfor decades to follow. Thanks to generous funding from Emory University and its participation in TOME (Toward an Open Monograph Ecosystem), the ebook editions of this book are available as Open Access volumes from Cornell Open (cornellopen.org) and other repositories."

Architecture,Arquitectura y Urbanismo del Cusco Inka,Ricardo Mar,9898974524.0,"Cusco, la ciudad más importante del Tawantinsuyu, fue morada de la nobleza y sede del poder político y religioso. El alto nivel de su arquitectura y urbanismo ha impresionado tanto a los primeros europeos del siglo XVI, como a los académicos y turistas que hoy visitan la ciudad. Los primeros la compararon con otras ciudades de España y vieron en el Qhapaq Ñan, la red de caminos que conectaba el sistema de asentamientos andinos, un equivalente de la vasta red de caminos romanos. Afortunadamente para Cusco aún quedan en pie partes significativas de su pasado Inka. Hemos catalogado las antiguas edificaciones, identificado escondidos entre muros o cimientos de construcciones coloniales y modernas, también los que perdieron su contexto y los que aparecen durante los nuevos trabajos en calles y plazas de la ciudad contemporánea. Estos datos combinados con la información que aportan los cronistas de la Colonia, la literatura arqueológica moderna, las fuentes históricas, etnohistóricas y de la antigua capital. Partiendo de la singularidad que representa Cusco en el contexto amerciano, Arquitectura y Urbanismo del Cusco Inka se ocupa principalmente de su geografía, planeamiento y arquitectura, mostrando a través de un amplio repertorio de planos, fotografías y restituciones tridimensionales cómo pudo ser la sede del poder inkaico. El desarollo de nuevas tecnologías digitales aplicadas a la arqueología oferece la posibilidad de avanzar en el estudio de la ciudad histórica de un modo hasta ahora desconocido. La gestión de fotos áreas y satelitales, los sistemas geográficos integrados (GIS), el láser scanner, el uso de los drones o los programas de modelado 3D automatizado, abren nuevas perspectivas en la investigación de campo y en la documentación de los restos arqueológicos, estimulando nuevas aproximaciones a la realidad del urbanismo Inka."
Architecture,"Fortaleza em Tempo de Carnaval: Blocos de Pré-Carnaval, Maracatus e a política de Editais",Danielle Maia,6588492863.0,"Resultado de uma tese de doutorado defendida em 2013, no Programa de Pós-Graduação em Sociologia, da Universidade Federal do Ceará, este livro, por meio de uma descrição etnográfica, conduz o leitor pelo Tempo de Carnaval em Fortaleza  expressão aqui utilizada para se referir ao ciclo anual carnavalesco que se inicia na cidade com o pré-Carnaval, geralmente um mês antes do Carnaval propriamente dito, e prolonga-se até a chamada terça-feira gorda, quando cessam as atividades carnavalescas ocorridas nos três dias do feriado nacional que antecede a quaresma. Com base em amplo material de pesquisa, apresento e analiso o processo de mudanças das festas carnavalescas de Fortaleza, ocorrido nos anos 2000. No âmbito das festas de Carnaval na cidade, das medidas tomadas pela prefeitura, a criação da política de editais é a de maior interesse para os objetivos aqui propostos, pois estabeleceu uma nova dinâmica na concessão de recursos, além de diferentes relações entre os brincantes e o poder público, bem como outras configurações festivas e formas de controle da festa."
Architecture,Dimensions. Journal of Architectural Knowledge,Virginie Roy,3839458315.0,"»Dimensions. Journal of Architectural Knowledge« is an academic journal in, on and from the discipline of architecture, addressing the creation, constitution and transmission of architectural knowledge. It explores methods genuine to the discipline and architectural modes of interdisciplinary methodological adaptions. Processes, procedures and results of knowledge creation and practice are esteemed coequally, with particular attentiveness to the architectural design and epistemologies of aesthetic practice and research. Dimensions Issue 02/2021, edited by Katharina Voigt and Virginie Roy, investigates lived experience as source for the constitution of knowledge. This edition is concerned with the movements of exploration and the inner sensations of being moved by experience. Addressing situational experience allows bringing implicit dimensions of perception to attention, enabling a tangible understanding to emerge - for the actual encounter, as well as connected to memory and imagination. Practitioners and scholars from various disciplines open the realm for theoretical, applied and practice-related forms of research, whilst all contributions are aligned to enrich the discourse of architecture and its versatile dimensions."
Architecture,Sourcing Land for Urban Development,Jit Kumar Gupta,9800000000000.0,"This book, 'Sourcing Land for Urban Development- Issues and Options', is a compilation of a number of articles, written over a period of time, with a focus on making optimum use of urban land for rationalizing and promoting planned and orderly development of urban settlements. Articles try to define and detail prevailing practices used for sourcing land for meeting the need of housing, industry, trade and commerce, institutions, etc. of cities and towns. Articles also try to detail innovative options, which can be leveraged for making available adequate land for meeting the urban needs at the most affordable price; using innovatively land as a resource, to make cities slum-free and promote infrastructure development to ensure appropriate quality of life to all urban residents; generating resources for urban local bodies for funding different development projects."
Architecture,Vienna,Yuri Kazepov,1000540448.0,"This book explores and debates the urban transformations that have taken place in Vienna over the past 30 years and their consequences in policy fields such as labour and housing, political and social participation and the environment. Historically, European cities have been characterised by a strong association between social cohesion, quality of life, economic ambition and a robust State. Vienna is an excellent example for that. In more recent years, however, cities were pressured to change policy principles and mechanisms in the context of demographic shifts, post-industrial transformations and welfare recalibration which have led to worsened social conditions in many cities. Each chapter in this volume discusses Viennas responses to these pressures in key policy arenas, looking at outcomes from the context-specific local arrangements. Against a theoretical framework debating the European city as a model of inclusion and social justice, authors explore the local capacity to innovate urban policies and to address new social risks, while paying attention to potential trade-offs. The book questions and assesses the citys resilience using time series and an institutional analysis of four key dimensions that characterise the European city model within the context of post-industrial transition: redistribution, recognition, representation and sustainability. It offers a multiscalar perspective of urban governance through labour, housing, participatory and environmental policies, bringing together different levels and public policy types. Vienna: Still a Just City? is aimed at academics, researchers and policy-makers in urban studies, including urban sociology, ecology, geography and welfare."
Architecture,Climate Adaptation and Resilience Across Scales,Nicholas B. Rajkovich,1000470997.0,"Climate Adaptation and Resilience Across Scales provides professionals with guidance on adapting the built environment to a changing climate. This edited volume brings together practitioners and researchers to discuss climate-related resilience from the building to the city scale. This book highlights North American cases that deal with issues such as climate projections, public health, adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations, and design interventions for floodplains, making the content applicable to many locations around the world. The contributors in this book discuss topics ranging from how built environment professionals respond to a changing climate, to how the building stock may need to adapt to climate change, to how resilience is currently being addressed in the design, construction, and operations communities. The purpose of this book is to provide a better understanding of climate change impacts, vulnerability, and resilience across scales of the built environment. Architects, urban designers, planners, landscape architects, and engineers will find this a useful resource for adapting buildings and cities to a changing climate."
Architecture,Ardeth #09,Felipe Hernández,9790000000000.0,"Architecture is an inward looking discipline. Its history conveys the norms of the discipline to an audience composed mostly of architects, who are familiar with the work of their predecessors-from whom they learnt, or for whom they worked. As such, architecture singularises the multiple processes through which space is produced, excluding difference in the pursuit of coherent narratives to sustain its authority, and does so mainly through the figure of the architect. For a long time now, critics have shown how that figure is principally male. However, little has been said about the fact that the figure of the architect is also white; a racial classification that refers not only to epidermal characteristics, but to their national origin, education, and in most cases their class affiliation."
Architecture,Le monete di Lucca. Dal periodo longobardo al Trecento,Monica Baldassarri,8892850776.0,"La monetazione di Lucca è tra le più studiate sia in ambito regionale che, in parte, in quello italiano. Lantichità e la continuità operativa della zecca cittadina, attiva dallepoca longobarda sino alle soglie dellEtà Contemporanea, hanno attratto lattenzione degli studiosi di storia monetaria e numismatica sin dal Seicento. Sebbene siano state numerose le ricerche e le pubblicazioni sulle monete lucchesi di età medievale, diverse sono le questioni rimaste aperte e svariati gli aspetti da approfondire. I nuovi rinvenimenti, cresciuti negli ultimi cinquantanni di sviluppo dellArcheologia Medievale in Italia e in ambito mediterraneo, associati a rinnovati studi tipologici sui materiali e alle possibilità offerte dalle analisi archeometriche, hanno offerto alcune risposte ad antichi quesiti, e ne hanno al contempo posti altri. Il volume ripercorre le principali tappe della produzione monetale di Lucca, dal periodo longobardo sino allo scorcio del Trecento, alla luce dei dati acquisiti dagli studi nel corso del tempo e di alcune evidenze ed esemplari inediti, proponendo in alcuni casi nuove classificazioni, datazioni ed interpretazioni, oltre che spunti per ulteriori sviluppi della ricerca."
Architecture,La arquitectura de la destrucción,Guillermo Iván López Domínguez ,6075135839.0,"¿Podrá tener la arquitectura el derecho a una muerte digna? El objetivo arquitectónico ha sido tradicionalmente asumido como algo permanente, perdurable y sólido, ha sido un depósito de ideales de trascendencia. Cuestionar la vigilancia de estas ideas es un buen punto de partida para revisar los supuestos sobre lo que se construye la disciplina, descubrir y entender mejor otra serie de procedimientos y operaciones que pueden ser utilizadas. El proceso edificatorio de construcción es sólo el principio de la vida material de una obra que, a lo largo del tiempo, tendrá que enfrentarse, en la mayoría de los casos, a la decadencia y al deterioro."

En las últimas décadas, la creación de nuevas titulaciones y el notable incremento de alumnos exigieron a la Universidad de Salamanca disponer de nuevas infraestructuras para desarrollar sus funciones y le obligaron a expandirse más allá de lo que había sido su antiguo centro neurálgico, consolidando al mismo tiempo la expansión de la ciudad hacia el Suroeste. A través de este libro se pretende poner en valor este rico patrimonio universitario, que al mismo tiempo constituye un hito en la imagen arquitectónica de la Salamanca contemporánea."

Architecture,Cities After Crisis,Carlos Garcia Vazquez,1000440494.0,"Cities After Crisis shows how urbanism and urban design is redefining cities after the global health, economic, and environmental crises of the past decades. The book details how these crises have led to a new urban visionfrom avantgarde modern design to an artisan aesthetic that calls for simplicity and the everyday, from the sustainable development paradigm to a resilient vision that defends de-growth and the re-wilding of cities, from a homogenizing globalism to a new localism that values what is distinctive and nearby, from the privatization of the public realm to the commoning and self-governance of urban resources, and from top-down to bottom-up processes based on the engagement and empowerment of communities. Through examples from cities around the world and a detailed look at the London neighbourhood of Dalston, the book shows designers and planners how to incorporate residents into the decision-making process, design inclusive public spaces that can be permanently reconfigured, reimagine obsolete spaces to accommodate radically contemporary uses, and build gardens designed and maintained by the community, among other projects."
Architecture,LA EUROCIUDAD DEL GUADIANA,Juan Antonio Márquez Domínguez,8418984112.0,"La Eurociudad del Guadiana emerge como territorio vivido, con vecinos de España y Portugal. La Eurociudad del Guadiana, extendida por los términos municipales de Ayamonte, Castro Marim y Vila Real de Santo Antonio, es el triunfo de los actores locales que quieren diluir la frontera frente a los Estados, que históricamente insistieron en marcar los límites, construyendo castillos y torres de vigilancia. Hace más de 25 años que España y Portugal forman parte de la Unión Europea, basándose en la libre circulación de personas, mercancías y capitales. En este contexto, eliminar los efectos más perniciosos de la frontera, como el aislamento que impedía la relación entre territorios, fue una meta. Pero, no es ni fue una tarea fácil, porque casi toda la frontera hispano lusa sufre las lacras de la perificidad y el vaciado demográfico, engarzado en procesos históricos de miedos y guerras. La desactivación de las fronteras se hizo con financiación de fondos europeos para remozar algunos núcleos de poblamiento y construir carreteras y puentes, cosiendo territorios separados, como si de un vestido roto se tratase. Por suerte la Eurociudad del Guadiana cuenta con cuantiosos recursos que se articulan alrededor del viejo río Anas, con un potente nervio económico en el turismo y promesas francamente interesantes en la agricultura. El libro Eurociudad del Guadiana es una presentación amable, pero real, de un territorio con grandes posibilidades."
Architecture,A pie o en bici. Perspectivas y experiencias en torno a la movilidad activa,Borja Ruiz-Apilánez,8490444390.0,"Los modelos de desarrollo urbano, de ocupación territorial y de movilidad con los que hemos sobreocupado y sobreexplotado La Tierra durante las últimas décadas han desencadenado la actual crisis medioambiental que tiene repercusiones directas también sobre las personas. Un cambio del modelo de movilidad que priorice los modos peatonal y ciclista los principales modos activos puede contribuir de forma decisiva a combatir y superar estas crisis. Este libro presenta once perspectivas y once experiencias en torno a la movilidad activa y se dirige a todas las personas interesadas en el presente y futuro de nuestro planeta, y en su propio bienestar. Cada perspectiva se aproxima a la movilidad activa poniendo el acento en un aspecto concreto: la salud pública, el medio ambiente, el diseño viario, la forma urbana, el planeamiento urbanístico, la gobernanza, la participación ciudadana, el urbanismo táctico, la comunicación, las nuevas fuentes de datos y las áreas urbanas históricas. Las experiencias son las de once ciudades europeas en su mayoría, españolas de características y tradiciones culturales muy diversas.

Gestores públicos, urbanistas, investigadores y docentes universitarios todos con un interés común en transmitir la necesidad de cambiar nuestro modelo de transporte urbano, dando a los modos activos el protagonismo que nuestro planeta y nosotros mismos merecemos."
Architecture,Oil Spaces,Carola Hein,1000449491.0,"Oil Spaces traces petroleums impact through a range of territories from across the world, showing how industrially drilled petroleum and its refined products have played a major role in transforming the built environment in ways that are often not visible or recognized. Over the past century and a half, industrially drilled petroleum has powered factories, built cities, and sustained nation-states. It has fueled ways of life and visions of progress, modernity, and disaster. In detailed international case studies, the contributors consider petroleums role in the built environment and the imagination. They study how petroleum and its infrastructure have served as a source of military conflict and political and economic power, inspiring efforts to create territories and reshape geographies and national boundaries. The authors trace ruptures and continuities between colonial and postcolonial frameworks, in locations as diverse as Sumatra, northeast China, Brazil, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kuwait as well as heritage sites including former power stations in Italy and the port of Dunkirk, once a prime gateway through which petroleum entered Europe. By revealing petroleums role in organizing and imagining space globally, this book takes up a key task in imagining the possibilities of a post-oil future. It will be invaluable reading to scholars and students of architectural and urban history, planning, and geography of sustainable urban environments."

Art,Observant Reforms and Cultural Production in Europe,Pietro Delcorno,9493296083.0,"The impetus of religious reform between ca. 1380-1520, which expressed itself in a variety of Observant initiatives in many religious orders all over Europe, and also brought forth the Devotio moderna movement in the late medieval Low Countries, had considerable repercussions for the production of a wide range of religious texts, and the embrace of other forms of cultural production (scribal activities, liturgical innovations, art, music, religious architecture). At the same time, the very impetus of reform within late medieval religious orders and the wish to return to a more modest religious lifestyle in accordance with monastic and mendicant rules, and ultimately with the commands of Christ in the Gospel, made it difficult to wholeheartedly embrace the material consequences of learning, literary and artistic prowess, as the very pursuit of such pursuits ran against basic demands of evangelical poverty and humility. This volume explores how this tension was negotiated in various Observant and Devotio moderna contexts, and how communities connected with these movements instrumentalized various types of writing, learning, and other forms of cultural expression to further the cause of religious reform, defend it against order-internal and external criticism, to shape recognizable reform identities for themselves, and to transform religious life in society as a whole."
Art,Toxic Heritage,Elizabeth Kryder-Reid,1000918017.0,"Toxic Heritage addresses the heritage value of contamination and toxic sites and provides the first in-depth examination of toxic heritage as a global issue. Bringing together case studies, visual essays, and substantive chapters written by leading scholars from around the world, the volume provides a critical framing of the globally expanding field of toxic heritage. Authors from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and methodologies examine toxic heritage as both a material phenomenon and a concept. Organized into five thematic sections, the book explores the meaning and significance of toxic heritage, politics, narratives, affected communities, and activist approaches and interventions. It identifies critical issues and highlights areas of emerging research on the intersections of environmental harm with formal and informal memory practices, while also highlighting the resilience, advocacy, and creativity of communities, scholars, and heritage professionals in responding to the current environmental crises. Toxic Heritage is useful and relevant to scholars and students working across a range of disciplines, including heritage studies, environmental science, archaeology, anthropology, and geography."

Art,At the Edges of Sleep,Jean Ma,520384520.0,"A free open access ebook is available upon publication. Learn more at www.luminosoa.org. Many recent works of contemporary art, performance, and film turn a spotlight on sleep, wresting it from the hidden, private spaces to which it is commonly relegated. At the Edges of Sleep considers sleep in film and moving image art as both a subject matter to explore onscreen and a state to induce in the audience. Far from negating action or meaning, sleep extends into new territories as it designates ways of existing in the world, in relation to people, places, and the past. Defined positively, sleep also expands our understanding of reception beyond the binary of concentration and distraction. These possibilities converge in the work of Thai filmmaker and artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul, who has explored the subject of sleep systematically throughout his career. In examining Apichatpongs work, Jean Ma brings together an array of interlocutorsfrom Freud to Proust, George Méliès to Tsai Ming-liang, Weegee to Warholto rethink moving images through the lens of sleep. Ma exposes an affinity between cinema, spectatorship, and sleep that dates to the earliest years of filmmaking, and sheds light upon the shifting cultural valences of sleep in the present moment."

Art,Egypt and the Classical World,Jeffrey Spier,1606067397.0,"Presenting dynamic research, this publication explores two millennia of cultural interactions between Egypt, Greece, and Rome. From Mycenaean weaponry found among the cargo of a Bronze Age shipwreck off the Turkish coast to the Egyptian-inspired domestic interiors of a luxury villa built in Greece during the Roman Empire, Egypt and the Classical World documents two millennia of cultural and artistic interconnectedness in the ancient Mediterranean. This volume gathers pioneering research from the Getty scholars' symposium that helped shape the major international loan exhibition Beyond the Nile: Egypt and the Classical World (J. Paul Getty Museum, 2018). Generously illustrated essays consider a range of artistic and other material evidence, including archaeological finds, artworks, papyri, and inscriptions, to shed light on cultural interactions between Egypt, Greece, and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Late Period and Ptolemaic dynasty to the Roman Empire. The military's role as a conduit of knowledge and ideas in the Bronze Age Aegean, and an in-depth study of hieroglyphic Egyptian inscriptions found on Roman obelisks offer but two examples of scholarly lacunae addressed by this publication. Specialists across the fields of art history, archaeology, Classics, Egyptology, and philology will benefit from the volume's investigations into syncretic processes that enlivened and informed nearly twenty-five hundred years of dynamic cultural exchange. The free online edition of this open-access publication is available at www.getty.edu/publications/egypt-classical-world/ and includes zoomable, high-resolution photography.

Questa occasione, giunta alla sua ottava edizione, vuole ricordarla nella maniera che lei stessa avrebbe apprezzato di più: attraverso i temi a lei cari, linnovazione della ricerca e le nuove generazioni di studiosi. Lottava edizione, svoltasi a otto anni dalla scomparsa della studiosa l11 Giugno 2021 in diretta streaming su Facebook e YouTube a causa della pandemia COVID-19, è stata dedicata alle Fonti scritte e iconografiche utili allanalisi delle ceramiche di età medievale e moderna. Sin dalle prime ricerche in collaborazione con Liana ed Ezio Tongiorgi, Graziella Berti ha affiancato lindagine sui documenti a quella derivante dai dati materiali, grazie ad un dialogo costante tra fonti di ambito diverso unite da uno scopo comune: raccontare e descrivere le ceramiche al fine di conoscerne le datazioni, gli usi, la circolazione, le terminologie, le tecnologie, la produzione. Allo studio dei documenti di archivio si è unito anche quello iconografico, ugualmente importante per contestualizzare e datare gli oggetti ceramici, consentendo, inoltre, di inquadrarli nei costumi e nella cultura del loro tempo. Le ricerche contenute in questo volume offrono un ampio sguardo alla realtà mediterranea di età medievale e moderna, con interventi che dalle porzioni più occidentali (Spagna e Francia) giungono, tramite lItalia e Malta, sino alle terre greche. Gli argomenti trattati permettono, tramite lanalisi delle fonti scritte e iconografiche e lincrocio con i dati materiali, di ricostruire le dinamiche di uso, gusto, consumo, produzione, datazione, circolazione, terminologia, moda delle ceramiche in un lungo arco temporale."

Art,Orphaned Landscapes,Patricia Spyer,823298701.0,"Less than a year after the end of authoritarian rule in 1998, huge images of Jesus Christ and other Christian scenes proliferated on walls and billboards around a provincial town in eastern Indonesia where conflict had arisen between Muslims and Christians. A manifestation of the extreme perception that emerged amid uncertainty and the challenge to seeing brought on by urban warfare, the street paintings erected by Protestant motorbike-taxi drivers signaled a radical departure from the aniconic tradition of the old colonial church, a desire to be seen and recognized by political authorities from Jakarta to the UN and European Union, an aim to reinstate the Christian look of a city in the face of the countrys widespread islamicization, and an opening to a more intimate relationship to the divine through the bringing-into-vision of the Christian god. Stridently assertive, these affectively charged mediations of religion, masculinity, Christian privilege and subjectivity are among the myriad ephemera of war, from rumors, graffiti, incendiary pamphlets, and Video CDs, to Peace Provocateur text-messages and childrens reconciliation drawings. Orphaned Landscapes theorizes the production of monumental street art and other visual media as part of a wider work on appearance in which ordinary people, wittingly or unwittingly, refigure the aesthetic forms and sensory environment of their urban surroundings. The book offers a rich, nuanced account of a place in crisis, while also showing how the work on appearance, far from epiphenomenal, is inherent to sociopolitical change. Whether considering the emergence and disappearance of street art or the atmospherics and fog of war, Spyer demonstrates the importance of an attunement to elusive, ephemeral phenomena for their palpable and varying effects in the world. Orphaned Landscapes: Violence, Visuality, and Appearance in Indonesia is available from the publisher on an open-access basis."

Esta cocina se ha preservado a través de la tradición, la resistencia y la perseverancia de las culturas originarias, las guardianas de este conocimiento ancestral, que está en riesgo de perderse debido a que la gastronomía se ha tenido que adaptar a los nuevos gustos y necesidades de una sociedad contemporánea y globalizada. En este libro-compendio podrán experimentar la resistencia desde la cosmovisión de las culturas totonaca, náhuatl y ngigua, e incluso podrán saborearla gracias a un esfuerzo por mantener su continuidad en la gastronomía mexicana actual."

Cooking,Desde harina de grillo,Annamaria Filomena Ambrosio,9581205845.0,"La incorporación de harina de grillo, como ingrediente en la cocina, trae diversos benefi-cios nutricionales y ambientales. Este ingrediente innovador se valora especialmente por su notorio contenido de proteínas y aminoácidos esenciales; además, su producción tiene un impacto ambiental mínimo, por lo que se considera una fuente proteica sostenible.

Por tales razones, en este libro se plantea la utilización de la harina de grillo en la cocina de Cundinamarca, un departamento de Colombia, ubicado en el centro del país, en la región andina, que se caracteriza por su biodiversidad y condiciones ambientales que favorecen la actividad agrícola. En efecto, en las regiones con climas cálidos de este departamento se encuentra la especie de grillo Gryllodes sigillatus (Walker) con base en la cual en la actualidad se está produciendo harina para uso alimentario, un ingrediente versátil que puede ser incluido en diversas preparaciones gastronómicas.

Cooking,Lukullische Hochgenüsse aus dem Tontopf,Peter Lehman,3748723768.0,"Das ideale Kochbuch für die Weihnachtszeit und weitere Feste im familiären Rahmen. Ein gutes Gelingen ist bei der Rezeptauswahl nahezu garantiert - ein bißchen Talent natürlich vorausgesetzt! Der Tontopf oder auch Römertopf gehört in die Feinschmecker-Küche, wie, nun, wie das Salz in die Suppe. Gourmets schätzen ihn, und das hat seinen ganz realen Grund. Denn endlich wurde hier neu entdeckt, wie die ersten Feinschmecker unserer Kultur, die alten Römer, schon vor über zwei Jahrtausenden Gerichte unübertrefflich köstlich im eigenen Saft schmorten. Warum dünstete und schmorte und briet es in der Küche des ersten Schwelgers und Genießers, des berühmten römischen Feldherrn Lukullus, ausgerechnet in Tonformen? Lukullus kannte schon den eisernen Kochtopf - warum bevorzugte er wie die Feinschmecker unserer Tage das Pendant aus Ton? Er wusste es genau. Seine Gründe überzeugen noch heute: emDer Römertopf ermöglicht das Garen beinahe aller Gerichte mit sehr wenig oder auch ohne Flüssigkeitszugabe. Das bedeutet, dass Saft, Aroma, Nährstoffe, Vitamine und Mineralien der Speisen voll erhalten bleiben, während sonst durch das Weggießen von überschüssigem Kochwasser ein großer Teil dieser für unseren Körper äußerst wertvollen Bestandteile verloren geht. Der Geschmack der Gerichte bleibt voll, natürlich und arteigen erhalten. Im Römertopf können Sie Fleisch, Fisch und Gemüse im eigenen Saft, mit wenig oder völlig ohne Fett garen und er erfüllt aus diesem Grunde ideal die Erfordernisse der modernen Diätetik. Übergewichtige und Schlankheitsbewusste wissen es zu schätzen, wenn man sozusagen unauffällig"" Fett einsparen kann. Wenn Magen"

Education,Life Skills and Adolescent Mental Health,Ole Jacob Madsen,1000926583.0,"Can school teach us to master life? This book confronts what the author sees as an ongoing trend in many Western democracies where citizens are increasingly being held accountable for their health and happiness. The author believes that the introduction of life skills in school shows a tendency to place more responsibility on the individual rather than address fundamental societal flaws that really should be solved politically. It examines how such responsibility to psychologically deal with these problems affects our mental health and quality of life. This book questions the fundamentals of the life mastery curriculum where we might be risking the creation of just another arena where children have to perform, challenging readers to evaluate more closely the premises, consequences and limitations of life mastery. The book, one of the first to question life mastery as an achievable goal with critical reviews of the 21st century skills movement, will be of interest to psychologists, school counsellors, teachers, students, politicians, and any reader evaluating school curriculums in relation to the decline in youth and adolescent mental health."
Education,Learning Diversity,Hans Karl Peterlini,3658405481.0,"This Open-Access-book explores diversity in its ambivalence. On the one side, we love to describe diversity as a resource for personal, social, economic, and cultural growth. On the other side, categories of differences often lead to discrimination or serve as justifications for privileges. They can cause exclusion and, conversely, promote the self-constitution of discriminated subjects and groups.The book moves within this tension of exclusion and belonging. Case studies of young ethnicized people vividly depict the interwovenness of identity-building and diversity. Theoretically, the book examines the psychosocial and anthropological conditions for constructing the Other. Sharp divisions between We and the Other, between social and national groups, and between humans and nature have devastating, life-threatening consequences. Dichotomous split-offs divide people, nations and the whole world. So, how do we deal with diversity? The author does not provide simple recipes but engages in a phenomenology of diversity that does not press life and its manifestations into categories but keeps them in a limbo of attention by affirming and doubting differences."

Education,Teaching India-Pakistan Relations,Kusha Anand,1800080433.0,"The rivalry between India and Pakistan began on British withdrawal from the British Indian Empire in 1947, and with the sudden partition of India immediately afterwards. It has proven remarkably resilient. While the countries share a long history and have considerable social-cultural affinity, relations since Partition have been marked by three wars, constant border skirmishes and a deep distrust that permeates both societies. In each, teaching about those relations is weighted with political and cultural significance, and research shows that curriculums have been used to shape the mindset of new generations with regard to their neighbouring state. This book explores the attitudes and pedagogical decision-making of teachers in India and Pakistan when teaching India-Pakistan relations. Situating teachers in the context of reformed textbooks and curriculums in both countries that explicitly advocate critical thinking and social cohesion, Kusha Anand explores how far teachers have enacted these changes in their classrooms. Based on data collected from teachers via semi-structured interviews and classroom observations in India and Pakistan she argues that, despite whole-nation policies and texts, teaching of India-Pakistan relations is dependent on the socio-economic status of schools. While there is progress towards the stated goals, teachers in both countries face pressures from the interests of school and state, and often miss opportunities to engage with multiple perspectives and stereotypes in their classrooms."

Education,El valor del arte,Rebeca Ivonne Ruiz Padilla ,607513638.0,"En su misión institucional, la Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro recalca la necesidad de formar profesionales competitivos, y para lograrlo ha establecido el arte como uno de sus pilares fundamentales. El valor del arte reconoce, en ese sentido, los caminos que éste devela para los jóvenes y sus aportaciones como herramienta pedagógica. Sostiene, de manera específica, que el desarrollo de la creatividad aviva el pensamiento crítico de los estudiantes y desempolva su imaginación. El arte crea una relación genuina entre la expresión artística y su contexto social que motiva a participar en comunidad y a proponer cambios positivos en el entorno. Es, en palabras de René Huyghe, uno de los autores citados en el libro, el medio de un perpetuo intercambio con lo que nos rodea.

Education,The Living Environmental Education,Wei-Ta Fang,981194234.0,"This open access book is designed and written to bridge the gap on the critical issues identified in environmental education programs in Asian countries. The world and its environments are changing rapidly, and the public may have difficulty keeping up and understanding how these changes will affect our way of life. The authors discuss various topics and case studies from an Asian perspective, but the content, messaging, and lessons learned need not be limited to Asian cultures. Each chapter provides a summary of the intensive research that has been performed on pro-environmental behaviors, the experience of people working in industry and at home, and their philosophies that guide them in their daily lives. We highlight humanitys potential to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by understanding better the environmental psychology, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability and stewardship protection elements that contribute to responsible environmental citizenship. The content of the chapters in this book includes a discussion of the crucial issues, plans, and evaluations for sustainability theories, practices, and actions with a proposed management structure for maximizing the cultural, social, and ecological diversity of Asian experiences compared to other theories and cultures internationally. We intend that the data in this book will provide a comprehensive guide for students, professors, practitioners, and entrepreneurs of environmental education and its related disciplines using case studies that demonstrate the relationship between the social and behavioral sciences and environmental leadership and sustainability."
Education,Towards a Global Core Value System in Doctoral Education,Maresi Nerad,1800080182.0,"Recent decades have seen an explosion in doctoral education worldwide. Increased potential for diverse employment has generated greater interest, with cultural, political and environmental tensions focusing the attention of new creative, responsible scholars. Towards a Global Core Value System in Doctoral Education provides an evaluation of changes and reforms in doctoral education since 2000. Recognising the diversity of academic cultures and institutional systems worldwide, the book advocates for a core value system to overcome inequalities in access to doctoral education and the provision of knowledge. Building on in-depth perspectives of scholars and young researchers from more than 25 countries, the chapters focus on the structures and quality assurance models of doctoral education, supervision, and funding from an institutional and comparative perspective. The book examines capacity building in the era of globalisation, global labour market developments for doctoral graduates, and explores the ethical challenges and political contestations that may manifest in the process of pursuing a PhD. Experts and early career researchers in the Global North and South collaborated in interdisciplinary and intergenerational teams to develop guidelines for doctoral education. They learned from each other about how to act courageously within a complex global context. The resulting recommendations and reflections are an invitation to reflect on the frames and conditions of doctoral education today."

Education,Emerging Epistemologies,Ziauddin Sardar,1565640128.0,"Our established, age-old notions of knowledge have ceased to be meaningful in postnormal times. What we define as true knowledge, and the ways in which we create it, have changed radically. The emergence of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, as well as fake news, alternative facts, deep fake, and post-truth have changed the nature of knowledge production. Established disciplines, such as economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, have lost their significance. Revengeful capitalism, based on profit-driven algorithms, has not only led to environmental destruction, but has also ruined our understanding of what actually constitutes knowledge. In an era that defines societies by questions of knowledge, it becomes necessary and urgent to ask: how is knowledge produced, how is it distributed, and who decides what is true knowledge and what is not? Emerging Epistemologies explores the changing nature of knowledge production and investigates how emerging epistemologies are transforming our perceptions of the pres - ent and the future. The contributors to the volume examine digital landscapes, zombie disciplines, higher education, the role of metaphysics, and epistemological justice; and argue that epistemology does not exist in a vacuum but is determined and embedded in the worldview and culture of society. The chaos and contradiction that accompanies our increasingly complex world requires us to see through the smog of ignorance, and seek new ways of thinking and creating knowledge that promotes sustainability, diversity, social justice and appreciates different ways of knowing, being, and doing."

Gardening,Polinización por abejas en cultivos promisorios de Colombia,Ángela Rodríguez C,9587753186.0,"El presente libro hace parte de los resultados del proyecto de investigación Valoración de los servicios de polinización por abejas en algunos frutales promisorios de Colombia, financiado por COLCIENCIAS y la Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Seleccionamos tres frutales promisorios, es decir aquellos cultivados y aprovechados en forma local, y que a pesar de su importancia son poco conocidos: Agraz (Vaccinium meridionale), fuente de antioxidantes; guayaba chamba (Campomanesia lineatifolia) fruto aromático y delicado aprovechado profusamente en Miraflores (Boyacá) y Cholupa (Passiflora maliformis), prima de la granadilla y el maracuyá, pero también poco conocida fuera de Rivera (Huila). Gracias a esta investigación aprendimos que las abejas son los polinizadores importantes de estos tres frutales. Según la estrategia reproductiva del agraz se estima que el 65% de la producción de frutos depende de la polinización por abejas. Por su parte, la chamba es una especie xenógama obligada y los polinizares son esenciales para la formación de frutos y semillas. En cuanto a la cholupa los ensayos de polinización demuestran que la dependencia de las abejas polinizadoras es alta, ya que sin la acción de estos vectores de polen la producción se reduce un 77.7%. Especies de Melipona, Bombus, Xylocopa y Apis mellifera son algunos de los polinizadores importantes de estas especies vegetales. Con este trabajo se contribuye al desarrollo de los objetivos de la Iniciativa Colombiana de Polinizadores (ICPA) sobre conocimiento, uso sostenible y valoración tanto de los polinizadores como del servicio de polinización prestado por abejas en Colombia."

Gardening,"Ympäristö, estetiikka ja hyvinvointi",Arto Haapala,9522229091.0,"This collection of essays looks at the issue of human well-being from the point of view of environmental aesthetics. Questions addressed include: What role do aesthetic values have in advancing well-being? Are there environments that are particularly supportive of well-being? What is the place of aesthetic factors in environmental and city planning? The authors of the first part of the book illuminate the relationship between aesthetics and well-being by discussing such notions and ideas as aesthetic well-being, interactive environmental planning, aesthetic quality in urban planning, aesthetic footprint, and ecological aesthetics. The authors of this part also engage with many topical questions in environmental and everyday aesthetics. For example, Yuriko Saitos idea of green aesthetics as well as Allen Carlsons science-based model of the aesthetic appreciation of nature are critically examined."
Gardening,Ancient Herbs in the J. Paul Getty Museum Gardens,Jeanne D'Andrea,892360356.0,"The Getty Museum building recreates an ancient Roman villa on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, where guests can feel that they are visiting the Villa dei Papiri before it was buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The climate of southern California has made it possible to plant the gardens with dozens of herbs, flowers, and fruit trees known to the Greeks and Romans. In classical times they were practical as well as beautiful, providing color, perfume, home medicines, and flavorings for food and drink. Martha Breen Bredemeyer, a San Francisco Bay area artist, was inspired to paint two dozen of the garden's herbs. Her watercolor gouaches combine vibrant color with the fragile delicacy of these short-lived plants while her pen-and-ink drawings share their wiry grace. Jeanne D'Andrea discusses twenty-one of the herbs in detail after presenting their place in myth, medicine, and home in the introduction."
Geography,Resilient Urban Futures,Zoé A. Hamstead,3030631311.0,"This open access book addresses the way in which urban and urbanizing regions profoundly impact and are impacted by climate change. The editors and authors show why cities must wage simultaneous battles to curb global climate change trends while adapting and transforming to address local climate impacts. This book addresses how cities develop anticipatory and long-range planning capacities for more resilient futures, earnest collaboration across disciplines, and radical reconfigurations of the power regimes that have institutionalized the disenfranchisement of minority groups. Although planning processes consider visions for the future, the editors highlight a more ambitious long-term positive visioning approach that accounts for unpredictability, system dynamics and equity in decision-making. This volume brings the science of urban transformation together with practices of professionals who govern and manage our social, ecological and technological systems to design processes by which cities may achieve resilient urban futures in the face of climate change."
Geography,Urban Planning Against Poverty,Jean-Claude Bolay,3030284190.0,"This open access book revisits the theoretical foundations of urban planning and the application of these concepts and methods in the context of Southern countries by examining several case studies from different regions of the world. For instance, the case of Koudougou, a medium-sized city in one of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina Faso, with a population of 115.000 inhabitants, allows us to understand concretely which and how these deficiencies are translated in an African urban context. In contrast, the case of Nueve de Julio, intermediate city of 50.000 dwellers in the pampa Argentina, addresses the new forms of spatial fragmentation and social exclusion linked with agro export and crisis of the international markets. Case studies are also included for cities in Asia and Latin America. Differences and similarities between cases allow us to foresee alternative models of urban planning better adapted to tackle poverty and find efficient ways for more inclusive cities in developing and emerging countries, interacting several dimensions linked with high rates of urbanization: territorial fragmentation; environmental contamination; social disparities and exclusion, informal economy and habitat, urban governance and democracy."

Music,Observant Reforms and Cultural Production in Europe,Pietro Delcorno,9493296083.0,"The impetus of religious reform between ca. 1380-1520, which expressed itself in a variety of Observant initiatives in many religious orders all over Europe, and also brought forth the Devotio moderna movement in the late medieval Low Countries, had considerable repercussions for the production of a wide range of religious texts, and the embrace of other forms of cultural production (scribal activities, liturgical innovations, art, music, religious architecture). At the same time, the very impetus of reform within late medieval religious orders and the wish to return to a more modest religious lifestyle in accordance with monastic and mendicant rules, and ultimately with the commands of Christ in the Gospel, made it difficult to wholeheartedly embrace the material consequences of learning, literary and artistic prowess, as the very pursuit of such pursuits ran against basic demands of evangelical poverty and humility. This volume explores how this tension was negotiated in various Observant and Devotio moderna contexts, and how communities connected with these movements instrumentalized various types of writing, learning, and other forms of cultural expression to further the cause of religious reform, defend it against order-internal and external criticism, to shape recognizable reform identities for themselves, and to transform religious life in society as a whole."

Music,Contingent Encounters,Dan DiPiero,47290311.0,"Contingent Encounters offers a sustained comparative study of improvisation as it appears between music and everyday life. Drawing on work in musicology, cultural studies, and critical improvisation studies, as well as his own performing experience, Dan DiPiero argues that comparing improvisation across domains calls into question how improvisation is typically recognized. By comparing the music of Eric Dolphy, Norwegian free improvisers, Mr. K, and the Ingrid Laubrock/Kris Davis duo with improvised activities in everyday life (such as walking, baking, working, and listening), DiPiero concludes that improvisation appears as a function of any encounter between subjects, objects, and environments. Bringing contingency into conversation with the utopian strain of critical improvisation studies, DiPiero shows how particular social investments cause improvisation to be associated with relative freedom, risk-taking, and unpredictability in both scholarship and public discourse. Taking seriously the claim that improvisation is the same thing as living, Contingent Encounters overturns long-standing assumptions about the aesthetic and political implications of this notoriously slippery term."
Music,Music and Democracy,Marko Kölbl,3839456576.0,"Music and Democracy explores music as a resource for societal transformation processes.

The volume further features approaches in the fields of gender, migration, disability, and digitalization."

This book encourages scholars in music circles and beyond to explore the intersections between social responsibility, community engagement, and academic practices through the simple act of working together. The books essayswritten by a diverse and cross-generational group of scholars, performers, and practitionersdemonstrate how collaboration can harness complementary skills and nourish comparative boundary-crossing through interdisciplinary research.

Each contribution to the volume is written collaboratively by two scholars, bringing together contributors who represent a mix of career stages and positions.

Music,Musical Composition in the Context of Globalization,Christian Utz,3839450950.0,"Since the early transformation of European music practice and theory in the cultural centers of Asia, Latin America, and Africa around 1900, it has become necessary for music history to be conceived globally - a challenge that musicology has hardly faced yet. This book discusses the effects of cultural globalization on processes of composition and distribution of art music in the 20th and 21st century. Christian Utz provides the foundations of a global music historiography, building on new models such as transnationalism, entangled histories, and reflexive globalization. The relationship between music and broader changes in society forms the central focus and is treated as a pivotal music-historical dynamic."

This book critically engages in current discussions about jazz pedagogy, inclusion and gender equity, beginning instrumental tuition, creativity, and authenticity in childhood."
Music,Can Music Make You Sick?,Sally Anne Gross,1912656612.0,"Musicians often pay a high price for sharing their art with us. Underneath the glow of success can often lie loneliness and exhaustion, not to mention the basic struggles of paying the rent or buying food. Sally Anne Gross and George Musgrave raise important questions  and we need to listen to what the musicians have to tell us about their working conditions and their mental health. Emma Warren (Music Journalist and Author). Singing is crying for grown-ups. To create great songs or play them with meaning music's creators reach far into emotion and fragility seeking the communion we demand of it. However, musics toll on musicians can leave deep scars. In this important book, Sally Anne Gross and George Musgrave investigate the relationship between the wellbeing music brings to society and the wellbeing of those who create. Its a much needed reality check, deglamorising the romantic image of the tortured artist. Crispin Hunt (Multi-Platinum Songwriter/Record Producer, Chair of the Ivors Academy). It is often assumed that creative people are prone to psychological instability, and that this explains apparent associations between cultural production and mental health problems. In their detailed study of recording and performing artists in the British music industry, Sally Anne Gross and George Musgrave turn this view on its head. By listening to how musicians understand and experience their working lives, this book proposes that whilst making music is therapeutic, making a career from music can be traumatic. The authors show how careers based on an all-consuming passion have become more insecure and devalued. Artistic merit and intimate, often painful, self-disclosures are the subject of unremitting scrutiny and data metrics. Personal relationships and social support networks are increasingly bound up with calculative transactions. Drawing on original empirical research and a wide-ranging survey of scholarship from across the social sciences, their findings will be provocative for future research on mental health, wellbeing and working conditions in the music industries and across the creative economy. Going beyond self-help strategies, they challenge the industry to make transformative structural change. Until then, the book provides an invaluable guide for anyone currently making their career in music, as well as those tasked with training and educating the next generation."
Music,Musical Gentrification,Petter Dyndahl,1000174743.0,"Musical Gentrification is an exploration of the role of popular music in processes of socio-cultural inclusion and exclusion in a variety of contexts. Twelve chapters by international scholars reveal how cultural objects of relatively lower status, in this case popular musics, are made objects of acquisition by subjects or institutions of higher social status, thereby playing an important role in social elevation, mobility and distinction. The phenomenon of musical gentrification is approached from a variety of angles: theoretically, methodologically and with reference to a number of key issues in popular music, from class, gender and ethnicity to cultural consumption, activism, hegemony and musical agency. Drawing on a wide range of case studies, empirical examples and ethnographic data, this is a valuable study for scholars and researchers of Music Education, Ethnomusicology, Cultural Studies and Cultural Sociology.

Music,"Representing Native Americans in Jim Jarmusch's Dead man""""",Issam El Masmodi,3346212548.0,"Essay from the year 2020 in the subject Film Science, grade: 14/20, Sultan Moulay Sliman University, language: English, abstract: This paper tends to shed light on one of the fundamental concepts in media studies, which is representation. While talking about minorities such as Natives Americans, representation becomes a process of stereotyping. The white American culture has always misrepresented Native Americans by associating them with derogatory descriptions. However, movies such as Dead Man came to recognize the differences among races throughout the history of America since Christophe Columbus discovered it. This paper also highlights other significant terms in postmodern and postcolonial thought such as rewriting history and intertextuality. As it provides a semiotic reading of Dead Man using the theories of Roland Barthes and other significant figures in this field."

Music,Vinyl Theory,Jeffrey R. Di Leo,1643150154.0,"Why are vinyl records making a comeback? How is their resurgence connected to the political economy of music? Vinyl Theory responds to these and other questions by exploring the intersection of vinyl records with critical theory. In the process, it asks how the political economy of music might be connected with the philosophy of the record. The young critical theorist and composer Theodor Adornos work on the philosophy of the record and the political economy of music of the contemporary French public intellectual, Jacques Attali, are brought together with the work of other theorists to in order to understand the fall and resurrection of vinyl records. The major argument of Vinyl Theory is that the very existence of vinyl records may be central to understanding the resiliency of neoliberalism. This argument is made by examining the work of Adorno, Attali, Friedrich Nietzsche, and others on music through the lens of Michel Foucaults biopolitics."

Music,Wagner - Weimar - Eisenach,Helen Geyer,3839448654.0,"Der rezeptionsgeschichtliche 'Urknall' von Richard Wagners Werk fand bezeichnenderweise an einem Ort statt, der sich in einem Spannungsfeld zwischen Provinz und Residenz, Tradition und Fortschritt, Idee und Verwirklichung befand: im Großherzogtum Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach. Hier verbanden sich Franz Liszts auf die Zukunft ausgerichtetes Wirken und das Erbe der Weimarer Klassik unter der Regentschaft eines ambitionierten Weimarer Hofes zu einer nicht unproblematischen Synthese, von deren Folgen auch Wagner nicht unberührt blieb. Die Beiträge des Bandes untersuchen diese Wechselwirkungen zwischen Kultur und Politik."
Music,The Performative Power of Vocality,Virginie Magnat,1000710750.0,"The Performative Power of Vocality offers a fresh perspective on voice as a subject of critical inquiry by employing an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural approach. Conventional treatment of voice in theatre and performance studies too often regards it as a subcategory of actor training, associated with the established methods that have shaped voice pedagogy within Western theatre schools, conservatories, and universities. This monograph significantly deviates from these dominant models through its investigation of the non-discursive, material, and affective efficacy of vocality, with a focus on orally transmitted vocal traditions. Drawing from her performance training, research collaborations, and commitment to cultural diversity, Magnat proposes a dialogical approach to vocality. Inclusive of established, current, and emerging research perspectives, this approach sheds light on the role of vocality as a vital source of embodied knowledge, creativity, and well-being grounded in process, practice, and place, as well as a form of social and political agency. An excellent resource for qualitative researchers, artist-scholars, and activists committed to decolonization, cultural revitalization, and social justice, this book opens up new avenues of understanding across Indigenous and Western philosophy, performance studies, musicology, ethnomusicology, sound and voice studies, anthropology, sociology, phenomenology, cognitive science, physics, ecology, and biomedicine.

O debate se dá num momento em que os esforços acadêmicos em música no Brasil se voltam para as possíveis interlocuções da academia com a sociedade em geral, e em que os sinais que apontam para uma direção clara: a importância dos aspectos sociais presentes no ensino da música na universidade."
Music,Music of a Thousand Years,Ann E. Lucas,520972031.0,"A free open access ebook is available upon publication. Learn more at www.luminosoa.org. Irans particular system of traditional Persian art music has been long treated as the product of an ever-evolving, ancient Persian culture. In Music of a Thousand Years, Ann E. Lucas argues that this music is a modern phenomenon indelibly tied to changing notions of Irans national history. Rather than considering a single Persian music history, Lucas demonstrates cultural dissimilarity and discontinuity over time, bringing to light two different notions of music-making in relation to premodern and modern musical norms. An important corrective to the history of Persian music, Music of a Thousand Years is the first work to align understandings of Middle Eastern music history with current understandings of the regions political history."
Music,A Buddhist Ritual Manual on Agriculture,Gergely Hidas,3110621053.0,"This volume is the first in-depth study of a recently discovered Sanskrit dharani spell text from around the 5th century CE surviving in two palm-leaf and three paper manuscript compendia from Nepal. This rare Buddhist scripture focuses on the ritual practice of thaumaturgic weather control for successful agriculture through overpowering mythical Nagas. Traditionally, these serpentine beings are held responsible for the amount of rainfall. The six chapters of the Vajratundasamayakalparaja present the vidyadhara spell-master as a ritualist who uses mandalas, mudras and other techniques to gain mastery over the Nagas and thus control the rains. By subjugating the Nagas, favourable weather and good crops are guaranteed. This links this incantation tradition to economic power and the securing of worldly support for the Buddhist community."

Music,Ambisonics,Franz Zotter,3030172074.0,"This open access book provides a concise explanation of the fundamentals and background of the surround sound recording and playback technology Ambisonics. It equips readers with the psychoacoustical, signal processing, acoustical, and mathematical knowledge needed to understand the inner workings of modern processing utilities, special equipment for recording, manipulation, and reproduction in the higher-order Ambisonic format. The book comes with various practical examples based on free software tools and open scientific data for reproducible research. The books introductory section offers a perspective on Ambisonics spanning from the origins of coincident recordings in the 1930s to the Ambisonic concepts of the 1970s, as well as classical ways of applying Ambisonics in first-order coincident sound scene recording and reproduction that have been practiced since the 1980s. As, from time to time, the underlying mathematics become quite involved, but should be comprehensive without sacrificing readability, the book includes an extensive mathematical appendix. The book offers readers a deeper understanding of Ambisonic technologies, and will especially benefit scientists, audio-system and audio-recording engineers. In the advanced sections of the book, fundamentals and modern techniques as higher-order Ambisonic decoding, 3D audio effects, and higher-order recording are explained. Those techniques are shown to be suitable to supply audience areas ranging from studio-sized to hundreds of listeners, or headphone-based playback, regardless whether it is live, interactive, or studio-produced 3D audio material."
Music,The Values of Independent Hip-Hop in the Post-Golden Era,Christopher Vito,3030024814.0,"Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this book uncovers the historical trajectory of U.S. independent hip-hop in the post-golden era, seeking to understand its complex relationship to mainstream hip-hop culture and U.S. culture more generally. Christopher Vito analyzes the lyrics of indie hip-hop albums from 2000-2013 to uncover the dominant ideologies of independent artists regarding race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and social change. These analyses inform interviews with members of the indie hip-hop community to explore the meanings that they associate with the culture today, how technological and media changes impact the boundaries between independent and major, and whether and how this shapes their engagement with oppositional consciousness. Ultimately, this book aims to understand the complex and contradictory cultural politics of independent hip-hop in the contemporary age."
Music,Middlebrow Modernism,Christopher Chowrimootoo,520970705.0,"A free ebook version of this title is available through Luminos, University of California Presss Open Access publishing program. Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more. Situated at the intersections of twentieth-century music history, historiography, and aesthetics, Middlebrow Modernism uses Benjamin Brittens operas to illustrate the ways in which composers, critics, and audiences mediated the great divide between modernism and mass culture. Reviving mid-century discussions of the middlebrow, Christopher Chowrimootoo demonstrates how Brittens works allowed audiences to have their modernist cake and eat it: to revel in the pleasures of consonance, lyricism, and theatrical spectacle even while enjoying the prestige that came from rejecting them. By focusing on moments when reigning aesthetic oppositions and hierarchies threatened to collapse, this study offers a powerful model for recovering shades of grey in the traditionally black-and-white historiographies of twentieth-century music."
Music,Well-Being and Mental Health in the Gig Economy,Sally-Anne Gross,1911534904.0,"A response is needed to the numerous issues spurred by the expansion of the gig economy, where flexible patterns of employment prevail in contrast to permanent jobs. In this context of the exponential growth of the digital economy and underlying business models the largest nationwide study of its kind into the impact of the working conditions in the UK music industry Can Music Make You Sick? has been conducted by MusicTank/University of Westminster. This research suggests the need to consider the future of work not only from an economic or employment law perspective but from a mental health one too. What are the psychological implications of precarious work and how are factors such as financial instability, the feedback economy and personal relationships reflected in mental health outcomes or connected to the business relationships most musicians and other gig economy participants work under? Authors Sally-Anne Gross, George Musgrave and Laima Janciute consider which policy measures may help or harm gig economy workers including the taxation of self-employed workers, a universal basic income, education around mental health issues and access to mental health support."

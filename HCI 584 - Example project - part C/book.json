From the New York Times bestselling creators of I Wish You More, Amy Krouse Rosenthal and Tom Lichtenheld, a funny look at the one day of the year that can compete with Christmas for children's affection: YES DAY! No matter how silly the request, there is one day a year when kids always receive a positive response: Can I have pizza for breakfast? YES! Can we have a food fight? YES! Can I stay up really late? YES! The simple text coupled with delightful illustrations will send kids on a journey into their wildest wishes. With humor and appreciation for life's little pleasures, Yes Day! captures the excitement of being a kid. Jennifer Garner uses Yes Day! as inspiration for an annual magical day of all things YES with her children. She was a little worn out after 24 hours of pure YES in 2017, but she still praised Yes Day! as \"a fantastic children's book.\"",

New York Times bestselling author Amy Krouse Rosenthal (Uni the Unicorn and I Wish You More), Lea Redmond, and Sanne te Loo have created a picture book with a story that rhymes and very lovely illustrations. But, oops—they’ve left out some important pieces of the story . . . and it’s up to YOU to fill them in! Step 1: Grab any small object or pick stickers from the back of the book. Step 2: Place them on the blank spots as you read along. Step 3: Laugh at the crazy story you’ve just created. Step 4: Pick new items and start all over again! Story time will take on a new dimension of play as kids use the stickers or scamper in search of the most hilarious items to occupy the blank spaces in the text. The endlessly innovative Amy Krouse Rosenthal and Lea Redmond bring us a way-outside-the-box adventure in which readers get to bend the rules and feel a bit rebellious as they tamper with the ordinary and expected.",

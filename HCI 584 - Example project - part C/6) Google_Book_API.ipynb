    "1) Instead of the books.csv data, we will now use the Google Book API (no API key needed!) to search for free ebooks by author or by title\n",
    "2) Refactor the TkInter GUI from part B to use the Google API search \n",
    "3) Add a button to open the result of the search withing a browser-based ebook reader. (Other GUI enhancements, such as showing a thumbnail for the result are optional.)\n",

    "- https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes shows how to use a HTTP GET request to search for books in various ways and with various filters.\n",
    "- https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#api_params is a summary of all parameters\n",
    "- You can dig into these later, for now, let's look at a simple, functional example of a query and analyze its response\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will simulate the query using the requests library (https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which is a very popular library for making HTTP requests. It is not part of the standard library, so you will need to install it with pip install requests below.\n",
    "- If the query was successful, the response will be a JSON object, which we can parse with the json library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), which is part of the standard library.\n",
    "- The JSON object will contain a list of books (items), each of which is a dictionary. We can use the pprint library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html) to print the dictionary in a more readable format.\n",
    "- Note: we are going to use this API w/o having registered for an API key. This usually works but it is possible that you may get a \"resource exhausted\" error, meaning worldwide more that 20,000,000 API-key-less requests have been made in the last 24 hours. If that happens, you will need to wait a day and try again (although I don't know in what timezone Google counts the 24 hours ...)."

From the New York Times bestselling creators of I Wish You More, Amy Krouse Rosenthal and Tom Lichtenheld, a funny look at the one day of the year that can compete with Christmas for children's affection: YES DAY! No matter how silly the request, there is one day a year when kids always receive a positive response: Can I have pizza for breakfast? YES! Can we have a food fight? YES! Can I stay up really late? YES! The simple text coupled with delightful illustrations will send kids on a journey into their wildest wishes. With humor and appreciation for life's little pleasures, Yes Day! captures the excitement of being a kid. Jennifer Garner uses Yes Day! as inspiration for an annual magical day of all things YES with her children. She was a little worn out after 24 hours of pure YES in 2017, but she still praised Yes Day! as \"a fantastic children's book.\"\n",

New York Times bestselling author Amy Krouse Rosenthal (Uni the Unicorn and I Wish You More), Lea Redmond, and Sanne te Loo have created a picture book with a story that rhymes and very lovely illustrations. But, oops—they’ve left out some important pieces of the story . . . and it’s up to YOU to fill them in! Step 1: Grab any small object or pick stickers from the back of the book. Step 2: Place them on the blank spots as you read along. Step 3: Laugh at the crazy story you’ve just created. Step 4: Pick new items and start all over again! Story time will take on a new dimension of play as kids use the stickers or scamper in search of the most hilarious items to occupy the blank spaces in the text. The endlessly innovative Amy Krouse Rosenthal and Lea Redmond bring us a way-outside-the-box adventure in which readers get to bend the rules and feel a bit rebellious as they tamper with the ordinary and expected.\n",

What is the connection among a failed suicide attempt, a wrongful accusation of theft against a schoolgirl, and the romantic life of a famous tennis player? To the casual observer, apparently nothing. But when a house party gathers at Gulls Point, the seaside home of an elderly widow, earlier events come to a dramatic head.

As most of the editions have introductions by historians, and some of them quite good, there is no readily available edition with a political science focus. Such a focus would not ignore the historical dimensions of the founding and that particular era, but would supplement this historical background with a concentration on the key questions political scientists tend to ask when reading and teaching The Federalist Papers. Questions of power, separation, blending, federalism, and structural design and how they impact the practice of government, questions we political scientists ask, will be the central feature of this edition. The primary audience for this edition would be courses in American Political Thought, American Government (most of which include components of the Federalist Papers) plus courses on the Presidency, Congress, The Judiciary, and Federalism.\n",

When Eris faked her death, she thought she had left her old life as the heir to the galaxy's most ruthless empire behind. But her recruitment by the Novantaen Resistance, an organization opposed to the empire's voracious expansion, throws her right back into the fray. Eris has been assigned a new mission: to infiltrate a spaceship ferrying deadly cargo and return the intelligence gathered to the Resistance. But her partner for the mission, mechanic and hotshot pilot Cloelia, bears an old grudge against Eris, making an already difficult infiltration even more complicated. When they find the ship, they discover more than they bargained for: three fugitives with firsthand knowledge of the corrupt empire's inner workings. Together, these women possess the knowledge and capabilities to bring the empire to its knees. But the clock is ticking: the new heir to the empire plans to disrupt a peace summit with the only remaining alien empire, ensuring the empires continued expansion. If they can find a way to stop him, they will save the galaxy. If they can't, millions may die.\n",

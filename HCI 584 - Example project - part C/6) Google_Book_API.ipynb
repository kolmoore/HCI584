    "- In this last part of the Example project assignment we wil:\n",
    "1) Instead of the books.csv data, we will now use the Google Book API (no API key needed!) to search for free ebooks by author or by title\n",
    "2) Refactor the TkInter GUI from part B to use the Google API search \n",
    "3) Add a button to open the result of the search withing a browser-based ebook reader. (Other GUI enhancements, such as showing a thumbnail for the result are optional.)\n",

    "\n",

    "- https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes shows how to use a HTTP GET request to search for books in various ways and with various filters.\n",
    "- https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#api_params is a summary of all parameters\n",
    "- You can dig into these later, for now, let's look at a simple, functional example of a query and analyze its response\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will simulate the query using the requests library (https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which is a very popular library for making HTTP requests. It is not part of the standard library, so you will need to install it with pip install requests below.\n",
    "- If the query was successful, the response will be a JSON object, which we can parse with the json library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), which is part of the standard library.\n",
    "- The JSON object will contain a list of books (items), each of which is a dictionary. We can use the pprint library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html) to print the dictionary in a more readable format.\n",
    "- Note: we are going to use this API w/o having registered for an API key. This usually works but it is possible that you may get a \"resource exhausted\" error, meaning worldwide more that 20,000,000 API-key-less requests have been made in the last 24 hours. If that happens, you will need to wait a day and try again (although I don't know in what timezone Google counts the 24 hours ...)."
